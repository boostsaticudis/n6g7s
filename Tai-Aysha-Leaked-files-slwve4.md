Tai'Aysha's music and message resonate with young audiences who find solace and strength in her vulnerability. She actively engages with her fans online, fostering a supportive and inclusive community. Her advocacy for mental health awareness extends beyond her music, as she speaks out on the importance of seeking help and normalizing conversations about mental illness. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Tai'Aysha has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Tai'Aysha has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
